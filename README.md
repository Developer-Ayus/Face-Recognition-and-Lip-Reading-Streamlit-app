Hi, This is a college project for "Face recognition and Lip-Reading". <br>
This is a streamlit application, running on your local machine.<br>
The Lip reading model isn't trained, if you have GPU, and the GPU is setuped correctly for Deep Learning prjects you can use "Lip_Reading_Real.ipynb" on your own macine, and train it, and use for presiction.
